## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2, part 1 

This was one of my favorite modules because it laid out the foundation of what we will be doing for the rest of the weeks. It was straightforward just using cin and cout commands, to create a Madlib sentence. Thinking back to this week, it was difficult to understand what we were supposed to do because I was knew to coding C++, but when I look at it now, I am able to comprehend it easily and figure out a way to shorten the number of lines of code that can be used. Overall, it became a memorable lab that we did in the beginning of the semester.

 

Lab 3, part 1 

This part of lab 3, was probably one of the hardest labs that I did in the beginning few weeks in my opinion, and so this means when I was able to have it complete, it was by far the most pride I felt at the time. The part that I kept getting wrong was the beginning equation, but once I was able to make the right equation and the correct spacing, I got it to work. This part also helped me learn about the two distinct types of calendars, the Georgian and the Julian calendar. I remember when I finished this lab, I played around inputting different dates into the code which gave me different dates back.

 

Lab 11, part 1 

This part of lab 11 was one of my favorites, it was challenging and when we were able to finish and complete the code, we saw all the population density from all the 50 states. This was my favorite lab out of all of them because of how hard it was, me and my partner kept messing up a lot, and there were times where we didnâ€™t know what to do, especially in the states_function.cc, but once we got help and finished, we were relieved. This lab also helped me learn so much about vectors in vectors, which was difficult for me to wrap my head around but once doing this lab I was able to understand it.
